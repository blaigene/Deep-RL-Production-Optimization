# Deep-RL-Production-Optimization
This project implements an autonomous production control system using Deep Reinforcement Learning (PPO/DQN). By wrapping a SimPy discrete-event simulation into a Gymnasium environment, the agents optimize job release strategies. Results show a 55% reduction in tardiness and 20% less WIP compared to classical PUSH policies.
